*I do not remember making that decision. This life, it chose me.*

In my previous life, I was an elf aged 314, working as a bard and painter. After unexpectedly hit by a truck, I was reincarnated into this world, with faint memories of I once knew.

In this new world, I'm trying to discover the source of mana. I continue my journey as a wandering, never abandoning my quest to return to my original world. I often delve into various ACGN realms, seeking any hint that could lead me back. To equip myself for this journey, I've accumulated vast  across numerous domains.
